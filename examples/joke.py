Hey everyone! So, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft lately... (Pauses, looks around nervously)

You know what's really messed up? You spend hours building this beautiful house, and then some green dude with no arms just shows up and goes 'SSSSSS' (Makes hissing sound, audience laughs)

I mean, who designed this game? It's like a home renovation show where the reveal is always an explosion! (Gestures explosion with hands)

(Shakes head) And don't even get me started on the villagers. They're like the worst neighbors ever - all they do is make 'hmm' sounds and try to trade you wheat for emeralds. I tried that at Home Depot once... security wasn't happy. (Audience laughs)

(Takes a step back, serious face) But you know what's the real kicker? In Minecraft, you can punch trees to get wood. I tried that in real life... (Rubs hand) Now I need both a therapist AND a hand surgeon! (Big laugh)

(Bows) Thank you, you've been great! Just don't try any of this at home... especially the tree punching part!""",
